            <p>Hi! My name is Tyler and I'm a sophmore in High School.
            I'm very interested in Computer Science and love to learn about coding.
            Recently I've been interested in java as well as html. I find it very fun to code for several reasons:

        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>It's Fun!</li>
                <li>I can see how some of my favorite games/websites were made!</li>
                <li>It allows me to create whatever I desire</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>And so much more!</p>
